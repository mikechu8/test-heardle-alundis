# How to remix this to make your own Heardle game

I remixed this from the Loona Heardle  
https://loona-heardle.glitch.me/

## Songs

- all the audio needs to come from Soundcloud, not any other streaming service
- edit "public/main.js"
- the answers are defined at around line #8587
  - add new items in the format `"Harry Styles - Woman",`
- the audio tracks are defined at around line #8627
  - add new items in the format 
    ```
          {
            url: "https://soundcloud.com/harrystyles/woman",
            answer: "Harry Styles - Woman",
          },
    ```
- the order of the answers should be the same as the order of the tracks

## Feedback

- feedback like "Unlucky!" is at around line #3906

## Sharing image and metadata

- edit "public/main.js"
- do a search for "Harry Styles Heardle" and update the text with your Heardle name and description
- edit "src/pages/index.hbs" to change the page metatags
- open the assets tab and upload your own image
- copy the image URL and add that to the page metadata

## Analytics

- go to google.com/analytics and sign up for your own Google Analytics account
- edit "src/pages/index.hbs" and replace the id in line 32, eg. `gtag('config', 'G-GPSR1C0Q60');`
- if you don't want to use Google Analytics you can remove that whole script block
